Go was concieved in september 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson, all at Google and was announced in november 2009. The goals of the language and its accompanying tools were to be expressive, efficient in both compilation and execution, and effective in writing reliable and robust programs.

Go bears a surface similarity to C and, like C, is a tool for professional programmers, achieving maximum effect with minimum means. But it is much more than an updated version of C. It borrows and adapt good ideas from many other languages, while avoiding features that have led to complexity and unrelaible code. Its Facilities for concurrency are new and effiecient, and its approach to data abstraction and object-oriented programming is usually flexible. It has automatic memory management or ***garbage collection*** .
