About the Author

: Hi I'm ***pradeek*** , I'm computer programmer and a blogger. I'm a technology enthusiast and love to write code . I don't like to work in time bounds so i work independently . Most of the time I write code and hear music . I like music because it rid all of my tension and don't get bored when you get write for a long hour . Most of my work related to web programming and I am not restricted to any programming language or technology , i always ready to learn some thing new . So I always update my knowledge and eagerly taught others too, it helps myself to improve several areas which I am not think yet . I don't like schools or any other institutions to get knowledge, I taught my self . Apart from my technical life my interest is in history and politics .
I admire singer ***Kurt Cobain*** and band ***nirvana*** who almost touched my soul. ***Nirvana*** is one of my favorite band . I'm a  sports person too, who love to watch football(soccer) and Cricket.

Things i like to do

: The question is what I don't like to do , I am a person of art in heart , I have interest in several things like writing and singing..etc (yes i am a terrible singer ) but my interests changed with the year and finally caught up in to software industry . As for me its not a boring job,but I'm not gonna lie, yea there are times when I got frustrated when some problem not get solved but its part of every job. So I chose not to mind that. I'm a big fan of open source programs.

: While moving to ***Linux***, it inspired me lots of things , You need to be patient enough to learn something. I read technical books and Google for getting stuff but lots of research and experimenting is needed to understand the idea. There are lot of people who helped me to grow my carrier. When I was in college I don't have a faintest idea of how to code . One day a friend of mine helped me to understand the funta behind the programming language. This thing I always carried away with me because sharing knowledge always improve your skills. Though I'm not a highly skilled person but still in the race.

: I like to do lot of things in my life , always want to travel and want everyday to be different. I believe computer programmers can change their society. I want to create jobs, it would be a help for others. In my place a vast majority of people are job seekers . I want to give back to society what society made me .
